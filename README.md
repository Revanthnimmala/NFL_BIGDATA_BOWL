# NFL_BIGDATA_BOWL
American football is a complex sport. From the 22 players on the field to specific characteristics that ebb and flow throughout the game,
it can be challenging to quantify the value of specific plays and actions within a play. Fundamentally, the goal of football is for the 
offense to run (rush) or throw (pass) the ball to gain yards, moving towards, then across, the opposing team’s side of the field in order
to score. And the goal of the defense is to prevent the offensive team from scoring. Deeper insight into rushing plays will help teams,
media, and fans better understand the skill of players and the strategies of coaches. It will also assist the NFL and its teams evaluate 
the ball carrier, his teammates, his coach, and the opposing defense, in order to make adjustments as necessary. Additionally, the winning
model will be provided to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats group to potentially share with teams.

#Objectives
•	Performed predictive analytics on predicting a NFL players will gain the number of Yards after receiving a hand-off by analyzing the data from the previous football games of each player.
•	Proved non-linear prediction models performed better than the linear models when bias is present in the data.
•	Models performed where Lasso Ridge, PLS, Random Forest, linear and Logistic regression in R and performed data visualizations using GGPlot
